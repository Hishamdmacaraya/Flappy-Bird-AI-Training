# Flappy-Bird-AI-Training
 This project involves training an AI agent to play Flappy Bird using reinforcement learning. By extracting features from raw game frames with a pre-trained model (like MobileNetV2) and then applying a Deep Q-Network (DQN) approach, the agent learns to select optimal actions (flapping or not) to maximize its score. The project includes setting up the game environment, preprocessing inputs, implementing the DQN with experience replay and a target network, and evaluating the trained modelâ€™s performance. The final deliverables are a report, presentation, learning log, and a Jupyter notebook with code and detailed comments.
